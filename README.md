## VGSALES_PROJECT
Video Game (VG) Sales Analysis Repository. This repository contains the VGsales dataset from Kaggle.  The dataset includes information on video game sales on 'Rank' 
'Name', 'Platform', 'Year', 'Genre', 'Publisher', 'NA_Sales', 'EU_Sales', 'JP_Sales', and 'Other_Sales'. The first approach i took before performing an analysis on the dataset is to prepare my dataset for use by cleaning the dataset. After cleaning the data i proceeded by running different analysis like

*publisher performance*,
*Regional sales*,
*Top selling games which I limited my results by 10*,
*The performance of the platform on each sales registered*,
*The relationship between genre and platform*,
*The relationship between publisher and platform*,
*Year over year growth / decline*,
*Sales distribution*, etc.

with Video game (VG) sales dataset I gained insights on various aspect of the dataset
